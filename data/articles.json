However in the game it looked off, what I found out was that I had the viewport in niagara set to show it without post processing. With post processing it looks awfull, but without it looks amazing. Now I do need post processing in the game for other effects, so my question is: Is it possible to turn of post-processing for a single niagara vfx?

    "summary": "Hello everyone, I’m gonna start documenting a game that a friend and I are gonna be working on. It’s really just for personal experience and portfolio work, but I will be spending A LOT of time working on this. The title of out game is called Rune Hook. It will be a cross between fishing and magic. The development will be all over the place, but I am going to tackle all of the realtime fx and a lot of the tech art. So far, I have established a water system, that I am gonna try to further optimize. It seems that everyone starting to tackle really nice water follows DeathReys amazing FFT setup. I was able to get it up and running in 5.4, there was a lot of weird bugs along the way but I got past them. As of right now, I am working on the buoyancy system, which is gonna be a bit challenging because I am gonna try to stick in blueprints (not really well versed in C++, only python as of right now). On that note, I am getting somewhere, I at least have a boat floating in some sort of way lol. And I also am working on a texture driven whirpool, using houdini to make some nice WPO textures. Once I kind of get all the big technical foundation layed out, I am gonna hop around more, but for now staying focused on these large water elements. 1 post - 1 participant Read full topic",
